Readme

In this repo you can find a excel document containing testcases for CRUD testing Heroku Computers application. As well as exploratory tests executed and bugs found. 

Moreover you'll find a Postman Collection and Postman Environment set-up. More about Postman can be found here: https://www.getpostman.com/ 
In this case, download the client, and import the Collection and environment and you should be good to go. 


In this repo, two protractor files can be found, though execution failed directly due to (I think) the fact that the https://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers 
is not build in Angular. My scripts failed directly at trying to read a title, which is definitely there. 

The protractor example shows a link to: http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/ 
Which is written in Angular and has the title at the same place. That test did run on my machine.
